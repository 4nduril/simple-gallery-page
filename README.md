# Starter for a Simple Gallery Page

Example live site: [Thailand 2020](https://thailand-2020.tobias-barth.net).

## Get started

Use `create-next-app`:

```shell
$ npx create-next-app <YOUR PROJECT> -e https://github.com/4nduril/simple-gallery-page
```
Where `<YOUR PROJECT>` is a name for the directory that will be created for the new project.

Next, `cd` into the directory and run `npm install`.
Before you can start the app you must create a new subdirectory with the name `raw-images`. Copy all the image files into it that you want to have in your gallery. Then run `npm run dev`.
